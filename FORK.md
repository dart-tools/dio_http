# Fork
This package has been forked from [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio).

Unfortunately, the original contributor of Dio ([Wendux](https://github.com/wendux)) went inactive for several months, and even though Dio is used in many locations, it's not stable enough yet so it needs active contributors.

We reached out to Wendux through GitHub issues on the repository, sending an e-mail to his contact information on his GitHub profile, and even tried to contact one of his organization members of flutterchina.

Unfortunately, we didn't manage to get in contact with him, so we decided to fork the package as dio_http.

The goal is to be a drop in replacement for dio, while still fixing bugs and following the evolution of the dart language.

We are still in the progress of evaluating stale issues and Pull Requests on the original dio repository, to hopefully fix them in the near future.
